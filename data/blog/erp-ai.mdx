title: 'ERP - The Software Everyone Loves to Hate'

summary: Every time someone mentions ERP at any level in a corporation, there's a chill that comes over the room. IT types cringe, accountants squirm in their seats at the very mention of those dreaded three letters and users just roll their eyes and grab an extra pint on Friday night. Why is that?

ERP software platforms are one of those critical pieces of IT infrastructure that nearly all companies require. Like going to the dentist, it needs to be done. Yet most companies wait until their servers require carbon dating before they even consider changing anything.

## Let's outline some of the reasons for this angst:

1. We had a bad previous experience
2. We already know the current system, warts and all
3. Cost of new systems is too much (training, new everything...)
4. Our whole business is on there - don't touch it

These are age-old IT issues and they're just as relevant today as they were 20-30 years ago. Sure, the technology has changed but most of the humans haven't. People hate change, especially with something as mundane as their business software. So, what's a company to do? In the following commentary I offer some new thinking on this issue.

To begin, I promise I won't utter the phrase "Digital Transformation". This catch-all phrase just makes your eyes glaze over. It's great for marketers and C-Suite-ers but means nothing. It's an upgrade, plain and simple. I'm no fan either way of Elon Musk but he does have a knack for cutting through crap and getting to the core of things. I thought it was quite cool that he built his own in-house ERP system much to the chagrin of the big ERP software peddlers (although he did rely heavily on Microsoft tools). Thankfully the rockets run on Linux.

OK, back to the task at hand. How do we slip-stream new technology into your ecosystem without a mutiny. Well, a lot depends on the type of business you run. Also size and age play a part. If you're an engineering firm, chances are your crew is technical and some may even welcome new toys. Older businesses landing outside of the technology stream might find it a harder sell. One good thing that wasn't as prevalent in the past is that today, younger employees tend to be more tech savvy. However, I have met a lot of young people who hate technology but at least they know the basics.

## Methods Companies Use Today

1. Rip the bandaid off and go for it
2. Buy new technology every X years
3. Patch like hell
4. Only upgrade gear that needs it

All of these methods more or less work. That's why we use them. The fact that technology changes every micro second doesn't help either. It's both a blessing and a curse. Contrary to popular belief, upgrades always cost more money. Software suppliers will tell you your life will be better, more effient and cost less with new products. The reality is, you just spent more money. There's a reason why Larry Ellison's house is bigger than yours.

## Enter Artificial Intelligence

It's no secret that the tech business is gaga over AI. Why? Money, plain and simple. Technology was floundering, ideas were running thin and it needed a shot in the arm big time. AI will be the biggest cash machine ever invented. Just imagine if you owned the "God" computer. You control a simple API that's the portal to all knowledge and charge a fee at the gate. Elon just bought 10K GPUs (good for hardware makers). His God computer will run his business and generate untold wealth for him by people who use his products. I'm sure he'll license the technology to other large firms and on and on it goes. The same scenario plays out across all the other mega-tech firms. They're the only ones who have the resources to command such a technology. The barrier to entry for you and I is less than zero. I'm injecting an AI piece into this ERP article because you'll need to inject AI into all future planning and I mean everything. In fact, I'm going to go as far as saying there will be a new epoch. People born before AI and people born after AI (B-AI / A-AI). Elon will determine this epoch I'm sure of it.

## The New ERP Corporation 

Imagine your boss turns on the computer in the morning and asks it: "How's the company doing today?". Within a few moments the boss knows everything that's required to make company decisions for that day, the next day/week/month/year who knows how long. Your companies' God computer is trained on all aspects of your business. If you're a smaller company chances are your leasing your God computer from Elon or Google or Microsoft which means these companies have all your company data. Now, if your company can't release sensitive data to third parties, this creates an additional hurdle. You'll need your own in-house God computer. But, you'll need 10K GPUs and complex software to build your own. Hmmm, we can't afford that. What if our competitors have a God computer? We'll be out of business. The bottom line is that you're going to be forced to re-think your entire business structure in very profound ways.

If you think through the question the boss asked this morning you can clearly see that many company touchpoints were removed by that one simple question. Sure, the employees still need to wrangle the data that's required to train the AI like sales reports and financials etc. but the key point here is that even many of these tasks can be automated. But, you won't lose your job! It'll just be different in a good way.

The new ERP corporation will be highly automated. All the data from disperate systems will coalesce into one homogenous machine trained on every aspect of the business.

## AI and Your ERP Strategy

One thing is for sure, ALL AIs require DATA and lots of it. In the short term you'll see companies become AI data-centric companies. What I mean by that is it doesn't really matter what your business does, it's just a data producing entity. That data will in turn be trained on artifical intelligence machines.

Having said all this, it's clear that companies will need to produce their data in a way that's easier for LLM's (Large Language Models) to ingest. Databases are now adapting to storing AI data with vector technology. The companies that utilize systems to streamline this data ingestion process will be the clear winners. I see this as the first step in moving toward an AI data-centric company.

This is something that can (and is) happening today. Will we still have accounting systems? Sure. Will there be all the other systems that go into running a business? Certainly. But how these systems work on the backend and frontend will fundamentally change. I see consolidated data becoming a first class citizen of all companies. How we interface with that data will also dramatically change. Business intelligence systems will change as well as the role of the database in the organization. Executives will likely trade AI prompts over a drink at the club.

## Moving Forward

I'm very bullish on AI technology as it applies to ERP. I think it will reinvigorate the sector and bring about great change and efficiencies. But it's up to the companies themselves to understand the power and capability of AI technology for ERP systems. As of the date of this writing I think the tech giants have done a poor job at communicating the benefits of AI in corporations. At the moment it's an optics issue. Everyone thinks they're going to lose their job and that's a hysteria you just can't control. Only with time and education will people see that AI isn't the bogey man and that it will produce more fullfilling work for employees across the board.

## Conclusion

I've outlined some new thinking around ERP and AI. I believe ERP should move to an AI data-centric model. i.e. All the programs in an ERP system talk the same language to the backend in a form AI systems can understand. ERP interfaces must be updated to a more human-freindly design. More natural language prompts need to be integrated throughout the system leading to a much more comfortable user experience. These are great selling points for a new ERP system. As far as the mutiny goes, well, we'll leave that to HR.
